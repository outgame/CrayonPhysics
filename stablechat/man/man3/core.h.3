.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Central physics interface with Chipmunk library\&. 

Core\&.h is visible only to files requiring communication with chipmunk and its structures like cpBody, cpShape and cpSpace\&. This includes both 1-player graphics and the server-side for multiplayer\&.

.SS "typedef struct \fBbody_data\fP  \fBBody_data\fP"
This struct holds everything needed in the preparation and storage of a cpBody\&. It will contain a 'point array', two identically-indexed arrays of x- and y-values for the vertices, but only during creation\&. After creation, it maintains the color of the body for graphics\&.

.SH "Function Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "void drawing_activate (cpSpace *space, cpBody *drawing)"
On mouse release Unsleeps the cpBody so that it will begin to interact with the space Also frees the GArrays in the UserData of the body but keeps color_rgb because the arrays won't be used anymore but the color still needs to be drawm
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIcpBody\fP *drawing to be activated when it is done being drawn 
.RE

Definition at line 162 of file physics\&.c\&.
.SS "cpBody* drawing_update (cpSpace *space, cpBody *drawing, cpFloatx, cpFloaty)"
On mouse drag Adds a new segment to the drawing if the mouse has been dragged past THRESHOLD Creates a new cpShape to add to the body Updates mass, moment, and center of mass of the body
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIcpSpace\fP *space that is holding the body 
.br
\fIcpBody\fP *drawing to be updated 
.br
\fIint\fP x value in world coordinates
